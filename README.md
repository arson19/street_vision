"An AI powered model for automobiles detection and recognition."

## Need
Car theft is a major problem in India. In fact, it's estimated that about 100,000 cars are stolen from India each year. This number will only rise as the economy strengthens and more individuals are able to own cars.
In addition, the number of vehicle-related or vehicle-assisted crimes is also rising quickly.

## About Model
To develop an AI-powered model for the detection and recognition of cars In CCTV footage. To get information about the vehicle we need to manually analyze the whole footage but this task is too tedious and inefficient as it is really difficult to track the vehicles of criminals in CCTV or to accurately identify them.
Here our model uses Computer vision and ML algorithms to detect vehicles in CCTV footage based on criteria like colour, vehicle type, speed and registration number
